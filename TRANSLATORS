Mirage provides a quick and easy way of creating a translation for 
your language. If you find this software useful and are capable of
adding a language that has not yet been translated, it would be
greatly appreciated.

1. Download the latest messages.po file. Please use the SVN
version, which can be found at:
http://svn.berlios.de/viewvc/mirageiv/trunk/po/messages.po

2. Use poedit (http://www.poedit.org/) to create translations for
all of the strings.

3. Join the mirageiv-translators mailing list:
https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mirageiv-translations

4. Submit your po file and keep it updated for future releases ;-)
